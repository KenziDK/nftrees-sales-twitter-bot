## Requirements

- [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

- Heroku Account (Free Tier is fine)

## Setup

Once you have been granted access to a Twitter Developer Account, created a project there + created an account on Heroku

- Clone/Fork/Copy this project to your local public/private git repo

- Create a new Heroku app, link up your Github repo to it so you're able to push commits up and see builds happening in Heroku.

- Make sure you are using `worker` dynos and not `web` dynos - can set this in the CLI your project with:

```sh
heroku ps:scale web=0
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

In the Settings section of your Heroku app you'll see a Config Vars section. Add the following config vars:

- **CONSUMER_KEY** - Your Twitter App's Consumer Key
- **CONSUMER_SECRET** - Your Twitter App's Consumer Secret
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY** - The Access Token Key of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET** - The Access Token Secret of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **OPENSEA_COLLECTION_SLUG** - The OpenSea collection name you wish to track (e.g. `cryptopunks`)

## Tweet Content

By default, in the tweet itself I am including an image of the item that was sold, the name of the item, the price in both ETH & USD, an external link if one exists + a couple of hashtags. Check out the [OpenSea Events API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference#retrieving-asset-events) and include whatever extra properties you'd like (such as seller/buyer addresses etc.).
